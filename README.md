## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a passionate game developer with experience in C++, C#, Lua, JavaScript and Python, and I'm currently working on a solo game project. I enjoy developing factory builder and puzzle games, a passion that started in childhood with influential games like Red Alert, Jak and Daxter, and The Legend of Zelda. Lately, I've developed a particular interest in factory builders like Factorio and Satisfactory, which have influenced the direction of my current work. To further enhance my skills, Iâ€™m currently learning Network Engineering as well as a little bit of AI Engineering to deepen my development capabilities.

*  I have been primarly working with LUA the past 3 years.
*  I am currently learning about various AI pathfinding algorithms.
