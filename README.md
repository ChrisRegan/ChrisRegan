## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a passionate game developer with experience in C++, C#, Lua, JavaScript, and Python. I particularly enjoy working on projects in the factory builder and puzzle game genres.

*  I have been primarly working with LUA the past 3 years.
*  I am currently learning about various AI pathfinding algorithms.
